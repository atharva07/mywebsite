                    <p>developers are the creative minds behind software programs, and they have the technical skills
                    to build those programs or to oversee their creation by a team. They create software that enables users to
                    perform specific tasks on computer devices.</p>

                    <p>Those tasks might involve playing a game, watching a movie, writing a business letter, or building a
                    spreadsheet. Specialized software is created or customized for virtually every profession, industry, and
                    government department.</p>
